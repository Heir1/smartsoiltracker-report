### 2. Power Management Relevance

#### ‚ö° Low Power Hardware Design

* The **FireBeetle 2 ESP32-UE or Arduino UNO R4 WiFi** operates on **3.3V‚Äì5V**, supports **ultra-low-power modes**, and allows deep sleep, ideal for **solar or battery-powered deployments**.
* We use the **RS485 4-in-1 Soil Moisture, Temperature, pH & EC Sensor (IP68, 5‚Äì30V)** ‚Äî industrial-grade, robust, and energy-efficient.
* No reliance on power-hungry display or wireless modules in the field ‚Äî system only activates networking when syncing.

#### üõ∞Ô∏è Offline Edge Intelligence

* All data processing and decision logic are handled locally on the ESP32 or Arduino UNO R4 WiFi ‚Äî no cloud needed.
* The embedded AI model provides crop recommendations on-device.
* Cloud sync is deferred ‚Äî triggered only when internet access is detected, minimizing power drain.
